##Installation Files

### Database Installation SQL script

The database installation script is included @ **resources/demo_files/installation/install.sql**.  Run this file to create the database.

A PHP script **load.php** file is included in the web-root directory (public), that will load the JSON file **landscapes.json** into the database.

##Explanation of Developing Gallery Demo

###Day 1 - The Front End

The biggest challenge of the UI for me was doing the 4 corner radial-gradient background.
I ended up posting a question to StackOverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64129123/only-two-of-four-radial-gradients-showing) with a JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/z0hxmb9j/1/)

###Day 2 - The Back End

The biggest challenge was learning Laravel framework. I have not worked with Laravel before, so the back-end took a few hours this morning to figure out. I ended up learning the API routing from the first 3 minutes of a tutorial video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du2yB9htD8k&list=PLz_YkiqIHesvWMGfavV8JFDQRJycfHUvD).
